= Importing Ontologies
:page-pagination:


Ontologies are serialised as RDF, so they can be imported using plain `n10s.rdf.import.fetch` but the `n10s.onto.import.fetch` method will give us a higher level of control over how an RDFS or OWL ontology is imported into Neo4j.
It's important to note that this procedure exclusively imports the following:

1. Named class (category) declarations with both `rdfs:Class` and `owl:Class`.
2. Explicit class hierarchies defined with `rdf:subClassOf` statements.
3. Property definitions with `owl:ObjectProperty`, `owl:DatatypeProperty` and `rdfs:Property`
4. Explicit property hierarchies defined with `rdfs:subPropertyOf` statements.
5. Domain and range information for properties described as `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range` statements.

All other elements will be ignored by this loader.

The `n10s.onto.import.fetch` procedure takes the same generic params described in xref:import.adoc#common_params[Common Parameters] at the beginning of the xref:import.adoc[Import] section, so we will invoke it with a URL and a serialisation format. In the following example we will import the ontology in link:https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neosemantics/raw/3.5/docs/rdf/vw.owl[this file].

We can see in the ingested graph that by default, classes are persisted as nodes with label `Class` with two properties: `uri` and `name` and `rdf:subClassOf` statements are stored as relationships of type `SCO` between `Class` nodes.
Similarly, relationships will be persisted as nodes with name and uri and labels `Relationship` or `Property` for `owl:ObjectProperty` and `owl:DatatypeProperty` respectively.
Statements with `rdf:subPropertyOf` as predicate are stored as relationships of type `SPO` between `Relationship` or `Property` nodes.

These graph model elements can be overridden by using the following configuration params in the Graph Config:

* *classLabel*: Label to be used for Ontology Classes (categories). Default is `Class`.
* *subClassOfRel*: Relationship to be used for `rdfs:subClassOf` hierarchies. Default is `SCO`.
* *dataTypePropertyLabel*: Label to be used for DataType properties in the Ontology. Default is `Property`.
* *objectPropertyLabel*: Label to be used for Object properties in the Ontology. Default is `Relationship`.
* *subPropertyOfRel*: Relationship to be used for `rdfs:subPropertyOf` hierarchies. Default is `SPO`.
* *domainRel*: Relationship to be used for `rdfs:domain`. Default is `DOMAIN`.
* *rangeRel*: Relationship to be used for `rdfs:range`. Default is `RANGE`.

Here's an example of how to load an ontology using some of these parameters:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL n10s.graphconfig.init({
  classLabel : 'Category',
  objectPropertyLabel: 'Rel',
  dataTypePropertyLabel: 'Prop'
});

CALL n10s.onto.import.fetch("https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neosemantics/raw/3.5/docs/rdf/vw.owl","Turtle");

Just like we saw when importing RDF, it is possible to pass the ontology as text instead of by reference (url),
the `n10s.onto.import.inline` procedure works in this  mode. Here's an example:

We first import a public vocabulary...
[source,cypher]
----
CALL n10s.onto.import.fetch("http://www.nsmntx.org/2019/10/clothingMaterials","Turtle");
----

and then we extend it with some additiona statements (triples) passed as text to the `n10s.onto.import.inline` procedure
[source,cypher]
----
CALL n10s.onto.import.inline("<http://www.nsmntx.org/2019/10/clothingMaterials#Leather> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf> <http://www.nsmntx.org/customCats#AnimalBasedMaterial2> .","N-Triples");
