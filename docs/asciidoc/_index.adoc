== Introduction

NSMNTX is an extension that enables the use of *RDF as a data exchange format* for graph data stored in Neo4j. It makes it also possible to *store RDF data in Neo4j* in a lossless manner (the imported RDF can be exported without losing a single triple in the process). Other features in NSMNTX include *model mapping* and *inferencing* on graph data stored in Neo4j.
